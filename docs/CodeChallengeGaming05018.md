# Unity3D Game Dev Code Challenge 
In this code challenge you should build a game from scratch that makes use of the payment API. The game should consist of at least 3 levels and allow users to be able to unlock levels using XP points from gameplay or payment (API). Inclusion of more than the payment API will also be an added advantage.

### Requirements
The game must: 
1. Have no less than 3 levels
2. Demonstrate use of the payment API using the sandbox

### Workflow:
1. Users can try to pay for a level unlock or a chracter unlock or even to top up resources in the game.
2. Your app uses the mobile checkout to request payment from the user
3. Your app preforms the required process and the user gets a response for their request.
3. Add to the README.md a small guide of how your game works and how to use the API in the game.

### Resources
